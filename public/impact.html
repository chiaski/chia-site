            <h1>How do you want to impact the world?</h1>
            <p><em>Since entering college in America, I've been endlessly thinking about purpose entwined with the sacrifice of generations before me who had never had the chances that I had -- feeling as if I had the weight of a country on me. </em></p>

            <p>Growing up in the slums of Manila, Philippines - I was lucky to find home in technology. I had the picturesque CS major background of coding in middle school, uploading flash games on long-deprecated online forums, and finding comfort in the agency of putting into action anything I had in mind. Finding friends from all over the world (at an age where that likely shouldn't have happened) and creation drove me, built my interests, and shaped me as the person I am today. However, I didn't have that in my peers. My vision of tech was shaped as this safehaven - a kind of idyllic space where I dreamt of becoming the next Bill Gates. In high school, suddenly tech was cool. This seemingly foreign concept from lack of CS classes or opportunities felt like something I could go towards.</p>
<p>With the grit to explore startups, I felt my first stepping stones in a Manila that tried incredibly hard to be the next Silicon Valley. Watching the same trends and "solutions" emerging, I felt a sudden moment of conscientiousness commuting over three hours to any tech event I could find amidst traffic, poverty, and distance to hear the scene's faces talk of values that never aligned with mine, nor the country's at all. </p>

<p>Coming from a background where creation freed me, I realized the value of impact and how tech has given me the space to potentially change the world -- if I guide myself rightly -- and how creation in the wrong direction and hands can withhold impact or even be detrimental upon human potential and society. Since then, balancing capacity in creation, democratizing that upon others, and redefining how innovation has operated have been my main missions, and have been what I wanted to bring upon the world. As part of this, I started a nonprofit at 2016 that aims to invest in youth-led innovation centering around students with visions for their own communities in regions that neglect this generation of creators, champion human-centric design for good, and campaign for tech worker rights and ethics across companies in the Asia-Pacific. Beyond, I think about justice and how I have fallen in love with a field/skill/identity that has let me seek it from virtually anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>
Oftentimes, I joke about how Silicon Valley is detached, or how my first CS classes in college are filled with the same people I feared to grow up as. It's not far from wrong at times, but from the very beginning, we're here because we believe we are capable of molding something true; reorienting the world through broadened perspectives and voices would only solve this. I like to believe I was born to create and move, as large as that sounds. But especially to create with others, for others. </p>
            <em style="color:#d2f0ec; line-height:22px;">
And then I dream of coming home where everybody can share in this. Where technology is no longer defined by faces or names, but the breakthroughs it has brought. And I again see every Filipino in the hours it takes to go home as not even saved - not yet, but at least in the conversation. Not as an afterthought.</em><br>

            <em style="font-size:11px;line-height:9px !important;">I was the Student of Vision Abie Award Winner speaking at the keynote of GHC, founded Developh to invest in and nurture youth-led innovation for social good across the Asia Pacific, and think a lot about achieving justice with technology &mdash; given how limitless of a space we're given.</em></p>
