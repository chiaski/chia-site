                    <h1>Strengthening community through measurable mentorship</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Prompted to <em>strengthen community</em> through mentorship programming, I was tasked to design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to discover one another.</p>
                    
                    <p>Even before entering Yale, students are given a wealth of resources: their residential college (future housing), upper-year mentors, and resident counselors that all form a distinctive part of their first-year experience: academically, culturally, and socially&mdash;especially in the overwhelming fall. Better this experience </p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Navigating a wealth of resources can easily be overwhelming to navigate for first-years ‚Äì and difficult to coordinate for upper-years: <strong>how can students maximize on these engagements and know when to access which resource?</strong><br>Building on existing infrastructure, I wanted to create an experience serving both mentors and mentees&mdash;bringing new opportunities for Yalies to connect that reflect the diversity of the student body.</p>

                <div class="container-invert">
                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>I talked to current first-years and Yale campus life leads to see what mentorship-based  transitional resources exist, and what might be lacking from each.</p>

                    <h2>Decision: Focusing on affiliated mentorship</h2>
                    
                    <blockquote class="testimonial">
                        "I want the opportunity to explore all my identities, but sometimes [the PL program] felt disjoint and overwhelming."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
From this, I decided on an experience that put these programs together on the onboarding end made it easier for peer liaisons&mdash;thanks to their less rigid structure and connection with cultural centers.</p>

                    <p>After deciding to target the peer liaison program, I continued short talks with first and second-years as well as current and alumni PLs and a now-alumni freshman counselor to synthesize their expectations and perceptions about current programs.</p>

                    <p>I looked at pain points from the side of both potential mentors and mentees.</p>

                    <p><strong>Peer liaison mentorship largely supports minority students</strong>: 71% of minority students in each class express interest in mentorship from their identity groups; yet significantly lower amounts actually engage. As a goal, I wanted to not only make the process more breathable and accessible, I also wanted to uplift the influence and impact of cultural centers in the development of new students.<br>

    <h4>Anna, an upper-year peer liaison</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to accomplish</strong>&mdash;coordinate with 10+ student peers in a manageable means; have direct access to updates from their cultural center.</li>        
            
            <li><strong>Needs to feel</strong>&mdash;resourceful and managed, that everything can be sent out and and checked on; empowered: if a mentee requests for a resource, they can find it and direct them appropriateyl</li>  
            <li><strong>Considerations</strong>&mdash;how can they consistently check-in and send key information while building personal relationships with mentees?</li>

    <h4>Derek, a first-year mentee</h4>
    <p>Navigating an overwhelming and stressful adjustment to the college environment, this mentee seeks opportunities to socialize as they navigate social circles while also exploring resources at Yale.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Needs to accomplish</strong>&mdash;a means for them to socialize and explore their self and identity with diverse sets fo peers.</li>        
            
            <li><strong>Needs to feel</strong>&mdash;secure: that they're welcome and their identity is respected and valued around their cultural center. Secure: in an overwhelming environment, they need to know it's OK for them to ask for help and it's there for them.</li>  
            <li><strong>Considerations</strong>&mdash;the peer liaison isn't their first go-to, they come to this mentor for needs related to identity, opportunity, and specialized social circles. This mentee is sure about their expectations, but scrambles and is unsure about what they need with how overwhelmed they are. How can this relationship be tapped into when Derek needs it?</li>

                    <p>For the exercise, I decided to rehaul the mentorship experience for the web. Students will be accessing these mentorship portals before arriving at school: I conducted look-and-learn sessions to see how students discovered info about their liaisons and went in contact with them. With the amount of thought/information on the project, the web was most intuitive for these longer onboarding experiences when settling key school flows.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        From here on, I began building mockups and going through cycles of product solutions to validate my assumptions.

                    <h3>Identifying solution areas</h3>
                    <p>From initial research, I narrowed down the current mentor-mentee program experience to three areas. These areas built upon conversation from our undergraduates will serve as our proposal's initial framework.</p>

                    <p>Because I'm taking on the task of creating cohesion for the liaison program, I wanted to continue building off the university's present systems. I reused components and titling through a small system on Figma.</p>

                    <h2>Project Area: Discovery & Connection</h2>
                    <h1>Connecting mentors and mentees with the information to succeed</h1>
                    <p>At core: new students have unpredictable needs, and should be able to smoothly access <em>existing</em> support systems as needed. Mentor  assignments are only done one-time in the summer; students can fall under more than one cultural center (like me); and emails at the start of a new school year are not the best way to communicate.<br>I thought it was critical to emphasize how students <strong>can request for a mentor</strong>&mdash;if not already reaching out to one they find on a list.</p>
                    
                    
                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em;">
                        <img class="image-full" src="../assets/portfolio/google/flow-request.png">
                        
                    </span>
                    
                    <p>In this proposed flow, I want to change the peer liaison process into more than a single request form: but an experience that allows students to learn about existing resources and centers around them. <br>These include a center page, liaison lists when logged onto the PL search for existing peer liaisons when logged onto the Yale network, and be able to request for mentors wih ease.</p>
                    
                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em;">

                    </span>
                    
                    
                    <p>With this, I developed a user flow for the mentor request process, along with a <strong>better request journey</strong> to help students communicate their needs and wants. This clarity in the mentorship process is key to productive relationships on both end, and helps students who communicate better in other means.</p>

                    <p>Because of the current matching system (administered by each cultural center), I stuck to single center selection ("Select a center")&mdash;but future systems could allow for requests from several centers at once.</p>
                    
                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em;">

                    <p>After a few days, prospective mentees should receive details on their match back on the site.</p>
                    
                </div>
                    
                    <h2>Updated Request Form</h2>
                    <p>In the request form, I opted for a more extensive application form where participants can articulate needs, interests, and goals for closer mentor matching. Fruitful relationships start with ones that engage with one another&mdash;these details, when also communicated to the mentor, help them better assess how they can help mentees and how to direct them to the appropriate resources.</p>

                    <p>I built a view for mentors to view each of their mentees' profiles. Think: notes left from the dean, changing ideas of success, an understanding of different communication methods, and helpful photos since names are easy to forget.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Mentorship is a two-way street</strong>. With these systems, there are more pathways to communicate expectations and measurements of success&mdash;enabling both users to <em>meet each other's desires.</em></p>

                    <h2>Project Area: Communication & Engagement</h2>
                    <h1>Bridging communication breakdowns</h1>
                    <p>As a bonus: I wanted to investigate how mentors and mentees communicate. <em>How can we make it easier for mentors to reach out to groups of mentees and align them with the right resources and opportunities? How can we provide communication channels for mentees to reach out?</em></p>
                    
                    <h2>MENTEE MESSAGES</h2>
                    <p>Throughout ideation: it was clear the consistent communication channel was email. This becomes difficult when mentors have to keep track of over a handful of students consistently. I proposed a sort of blue sky system where mentors can put together mentee announcements with ease; embedding events and other opportunities that they normally deliver.</p>
                    
                    <p>I proposed an addition to the portal where mentors can send out a "newsletter" to their mentees.</p>
                    
                    
                    <span class="image-container" style="padding:1em;">

                    </span>

                   
                    <p>I didn't go too in-depth on the design for the newsletter: there are existing systems for them, and I would just imagine these are standardized to some extent. The portal's collection of resources and upcoming center events, plus likely announcements and reminders from cultural centers on news to disseminate will help mentors reach out.</p>
                    
                    <p></p>

                    </span>

                    <p>These mentee newsletters also give the opportunity for group meetings and events beyond one-on-one meetups: when mentors put out gatherings, they can see student responses.</p>
                    
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consistent Communication</strong>: Offers group events, opportunities, and guidance; accessible to students at any time of the academic year and sustains written engagement.</li>

                        <li><strong>Cultural Center Connections</strong>: Forwards information and programming specific to each cultural center, encouraging engagement. </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Centralize event planning</strong>: With the portal offering consolidated information on center activities, this is a perfect way for different mentors to coordinate one another and ease work&mdash;while letting first-years expand their networks!</li>

                    <h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
                    <h1>Infrastructure as the center for human connection</h1>
                    
                    <p> The project was reflective: there's no point in offering resources when they're difficult to navigate and disjoint ‚Äì uncovering these breakdowns in the mentorship system helped me understand how to better bridge relationships. Tackling mentorship at Yale is significant: every student wants to give back, and we're fortunate to have existing resources. At the same time, there's so much room for improvement.</p>
                    
                    <p>Building on existing infrastructures and systems to make cohesive processes is critical. I stuck to principles of clarity, empathy, and "capacity" in this project: I wanted to <strong>maximize the potential of productive, meaningful human interaction while under university constraints</strong>, tackling consistency fixes to trying out a blue sky approach. These new flows center <strong>community</strong>. These interactions are not just between mentor and mentee, they are between the systems that Yale provides and <strong>challenge all participants to partake in a larger ecosystem.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>For next steps,</strong> discussion with cultural centers and implementing bodies would be key. I talked to mostly mentors and mentees and was able to define a product that tackled communication & discovery issues&mdash;but I want to see what tangible parts of the process can lead to more measurable support for cultural centers, especially with inter-center programming.</p>
